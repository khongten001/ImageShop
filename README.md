# What is Image Shop?
Image Shop is a small teaching application that allows students to write functions using the Free Pascal language and see the results.

After a student write a function, they can run the Image Shop program and drop it on a canvas and connect it to other functions or images. Many functions can be combined to create new and interesteding image effects.

Image Shop can run on any platform. Prebuilt binaries and a short introduction video [are located here](https://www.getlazarus.org/learn/tutorials/examples/imageshop/).
